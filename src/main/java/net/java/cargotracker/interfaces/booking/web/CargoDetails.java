/**
 * Handles viewing cargo details. Operates against a dedicated service facade,
 * and could easily be rewritten as a thick Swing client. Completely separated
 * from the domain layer, unlike the tracking user interface.
 * <p/>
 * In order to successfully keep the domain model shielded from user interface
 * considerations, this approach is generally preferred to the one taken in the
 * tracking controller. However, there is never any one perfect solution for all
 * situations, so we've chosen to demonstrate two polarized ways to build user
 * interfaces.
