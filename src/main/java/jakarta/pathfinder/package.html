  This is the pathfinder application context, which is separate from "our" application and context.
  Our domain model with cargo, itinerary, handling event etc does not exist here.
  The routing domain service implementation works against the API exposed by
  this context.

<p>
  It is not related to the core application at all, and is only part of this source tree for
  developer convenience.
